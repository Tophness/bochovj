#summary How to setup eclipse for usign the code.

= Setup instructions =

First of all download Eclipse:  http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
The SE version will do fine (Eclipse IDE for Java Developers).

Donwload a SVN client. Eclipse has one by default, you can find it in the plugins, just look for SVN in Help->Install new software, then choose your's Eclipse version repository (e.g. Galileo).

Download further libraries, we use JMF for the MIDI drawer: http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/desktop/media/jmf/2.1.1/download.html

Download the code from SVN doing a checkout, and switch the Eclipse workspace to where you've downloaded the code / java.

Create a java classpath variable: Window->Preferences->Java->BuildPath->ClassPath variables->New. Name it "Libraries" (without quotes) and select Folder. Point it to the Libraries subdirectory in the java directory.

Import the existing projects and compile (should compile automatically).

Everything's fine?
