#summary Common Java Project

The Common Java Project contains tools that are shared among other projects.

Currently two main packages are included:

==draw==

Contains an abstract specification of a program that draws strokes painted with the mouse on the screen.
The program captures the strokes, buffers them and makes them disappear in time, but does not actually draw them.

==video==

Is a simple grabber of images from a live video, a wrapper for JMF
