#summary A program that translates Drawings into Midi
#labels Midi

= Introduction =

The aim of this project is to provide a technical mean to translate drawings into musical messages. The idea is not the one of creating another Midi sequencer, but something like an "interpreter" of a free hand drawing.

Technically the program will draw mouse inputs and will generate "features" from the drawn points.

The generated midi messages are most likely to be controller messages (although in principle it is possible to generates notes as well).

There is also the possibility to use live images from an external video source, like webcams.

The project is still at its very first stage, but will grow quickly!
