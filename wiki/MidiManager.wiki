= Introduction =

The MidiManager project is a simple wrapper for the [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/package-summary.html javax.sound.midi] library.

It defines an interface that handles midi events sent by a physical midi device, a wrapper to start a midi input and a wrapper to start a midi output.

Moreover it gives a simple GUI (using Swing) to list and select the device from the local computer.
