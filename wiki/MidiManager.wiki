= Introduction =

The MidiManager project is a simple wrapper for the [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/package-summary.html javax.sound.midi] library.

It defines an interface that handles midi events sent by a physical midi device, a wrapper to start a midi input and a wrapper to start a midi output.

Moreover it gives a simple GUI (using Swing) to list and select the device from the local computer.


SerialToMidi:

is a tool that just routes midi messages coming from a serial port to a midi device.

The library uses the JavaComm library

Currently I have imported the Windows version of the library, which has been discontinued years ago, but it still downloadable [http://wind.lcs.mit.edu/download/java/javacomm20-win32.zip here]


Another possibiliy is using a Serial to Midi driver, which would act at the operating system level.
The most famous driver is the Roland, but is quite old and does not support more recent OSs. A better (IMHO) driver is produced by Yamaha and can be downloaded [http://download.yamaha.com/usb_midi/index.html here]
