#summary Description of the RFDuinoRGB project

= Introduction =

I have bought a [http://www.rfduino.com/ RFduino board] some time ago and I really think it's a cool project.
The board comes with some example applications for iOS, but since I have an Android phone (and I hate Apple), I had to make my apps myself.


= Project =

[https://code.google.com/p/bochovj/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FAndroid%2FRFDuinoRGB Link] to the project's folder.

RFduino is a small app, all contained in one class, that controls the RGB LED of the [http://www.rfduino.com/rfd22122-rgb-pushbutton-shield-accessory-board.html RGB pushbutton shield] of RFduino. On RFduino you need to load the ColorWheel example sketch to make it work.

This simple application shows some basic functionalities of the Bluetooth LE API of Android: discovery of devices, services discovery, connection and sending data.
I have programmed it while I was learning both Android and BLE so it's probable that there are some errors and some naiveties.
